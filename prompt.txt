I’m building a mobile app called **PoolTracker** using **React Native with Expo**. I’m a beginner computer science student and want the code to be simple, well-commented, and easy to understand as I learn.

---

### 🔧 Tech Stack (Use Only These):

- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Framework:** React Native (via Expo)
- **Navigation:** React Navigation (bottom tabs)
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore + Firebase Auth)
- **Maps:** react-native-maps (Google Maps)
- **Charts:** Victory Native (for future chemical tracking graphs)
- **UI components:** React Native built-ins (or simple, lightweight libraries only)
- **Project structure:** Use `/screens`, `/components`, `/firebase`, etc.

---

### 🎨 App Style & Theme:

Use a clean, modern design with a “pool tech” vibe:
- Background: white or very light gray
- Primary accent color: pool blue (`#00BFFF`)
- Text: dark navy or black
- Reminder/highlight color: soft yellow or orange
- Use safe areas, spacing, and padding for a mobile-friendly layout
- Rounded corners on cards and buttons

---

### 📱 App Structure and Screens:

#### 1. **Home Screen**
- A nice and modern layout with today’s date at the top
- Card-style list of today’s tasks (e.g., “Account 6 - Add chlorine”)
- Weekly reminders section (e.g., “Filter cleaning for Account 3 on Friday”)

#### 2. **Current Pool Screen**
- Display the next pool on the schedule
- Include a manual search option to pull up a specific pool by name
- Add a placeholder message: “Photo test strip analysis coming soon”

#### 3. **Chemical Tracker Screen**
- Manually log chemicals added to a pool (chemical, amount, date)
- Show entries in a clean list with timestamps
- Placeholder section for a future chart (Victory)
- Fields for pool volume and chemical strength (no logic yet)
- Clearly label the chart section as “WIP – Automation coming soon”

#### 4. **Map/Route Screen**
- Use `react-native-maps` to show:
  - Gray pins = all pools
  - Blue pins = today's pools
  - Yellow/orange pins = pools with “to-do” tasks
  - Teal pins = mock Leslie’s Pool Supply store locations
- Use sample coordinates for now

#### 5. **Schedule Screen**
- Weekly calendar view of upcoming pool appointments
- Easy-to-read layout, possibly card style per day

#### 6. **Billing Screen**
- List of accounts showing paid/unpaid status (green check / red X)
- Show mock total expenses per account
- Tabs or sections for “Receipts” and “Expenses”

---

### 🧭 Navigation
- Set up a bottom tab bar like Instagram or Twitter, with icons and labels for these screens:
Home, Current Pool, Map, Schedule, and Billing.
The tab bar should stay fixed at the bottom and let users switch between screens easily.
Use @react-navigation/bottom-tabs and react-native-vector-icons to style the icons and labels.

---

### 🔐 Firebase Setup
- Use my existing `firebase.js` file in the project root
- Set up Firebase Auth (email + password login/register)
- Set up Firestore
- Store and retrieve to-do list items and pool info
- Use mock data unless otherwise specified

---

### 🧼 Code & Structure
- Organize code into `/screens`, `/components`, and `/firebase`
- Keep code clean, commented, and beginner-friendly
- Use mock/dummy data for now to simulate tasks and accounts
- Label any future or incomplete features clearly

---

### ❌ Do NOT Build Yet:
- Do not build the test strip photo analyzer or smart chemical suggestions yet
- Just leave placeholders and comments labeled: "Coming soon"

---

Once this setup is complete, help me build and test one screen or feature at a time.
